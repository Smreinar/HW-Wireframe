                            My name is Steven and as I was growing up I've always had a love for technology. I've been on the computer sense i was 6years old However, 
                        I didnt adventure into coding untill I was in highschool.
                        I started with something simple like game design as an elective for school and enjoyed it very much even though, the teacher wasnt much help.
                        Then I later moved forward to self teaching HTML5, CSS and a little bit of javaScript. Now I am attending UOA online coding bootcamp which, 
                        I can say with confidence that I am loving it. Everyday I am learning more and more with their 6month program and I am excited to see what
                         path this class can take me for my future.
