                        My name is Steven, and as I was growing up, I've always had a love for technology. 
                        I've been on the computer since I was six years old. However, I didn't adventure into coding until I was in high school. 
                        I started with something simple, Game design. As an elective for school, I enjoyed it very much. The teacher wasn't much help.
                         Then I later moved forward into self-teaching HTML5, CSS, and a little bit of javaScript. Now I am attending UOA online coding Bootcamp.
                          I can say with confidence that I love it! Every day I am growing my knowledge with their six-month program, and 
                          I am excited to see what path this class will take me for my future.
